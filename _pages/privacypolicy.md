# Privacy Policy

<br>

Iconic and its developer take your privacy very seriously. Iconic does not sell or rent your data, and anonymous information is only collected to help make the app better.

Iconic uses TelemetryDeck to collect anonymized usage data. This helps me understand how users are using Iconic and how it can be improved. TelemetryDeck does not collect any personally identifiable information. You can read more about TelemetryDeckâ€™s privacy policy at https://telemetrydeck.com/privacy. Users can opt out at any time via Settings tab > General > Share Iconic Analytics.
